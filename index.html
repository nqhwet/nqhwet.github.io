            <h1 class="heading">Inspiring UI/UX DESIGNER</h1>
                <p>I want to get into UI/UX design in the  first place, because it has a higher ceiling and more earining potential than other industries. A smaller learning curve into the tech industry. It has  interdisciplinary nature and how it plugs into any other field.The natural progression from other fields of design.Al so it has the ability to focus on people while still working within the tech industry and it has wide range of activities from which to choose</p>
